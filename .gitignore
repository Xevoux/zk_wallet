# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (cPanel - No SSH)
# ============================================
# For deployment without SSH/terminal access:
# - Built assets (/public/build) are COMMITTED
# - Vendor folder should be uploaded
# - .env must be created manually on server
# ============================================
